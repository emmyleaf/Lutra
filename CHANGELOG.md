## 0.3.1

- Framework requirement upped to the latest LTS, .NET8
- Under the hood, we have moved from SDL2 to SDL3!
- Likewise, we now use the `ppy.Veldrid` fork of Veldrid.
- This will likely be the version used for the 1.0 release of "Bean To Me!" on Steam.

## 0.3.0

- Add `Lutra.MIDI` optional add-on project
- Add experimental asset archive format LUTARC
- Tweaks and fixes for the demo version of "Bean To Me!"

## 0.2.0

- `Surface` now implements the majority of the functionality it had in Otter. This includes:
  - Extends `Image` so can now be used as a `Graphic`.
  - `ClearColor` and `AutoClear` properties.
  - `Draw` method which draws Graphics directly to the `Surface`.
  - `UseSceneCamera` property, which when set to false applies a neutral camera on render.
- `Graphic.Layer` can fall back to its Entity's `Layer` value if not set (Otter compat).
- `Graphic` can have a set of `Surface`s to draw to, which can also fall back to a value set on its Entity (Otter compat).
- `SpriteGraphic.Smooth` property now applies linear sampling when true.
- `SpriteGraphic.Blend` property can now be set to either `Alpha` or `Add` blend modes.
- `FontPageTexture` can now enlarge its texture when full.
- `LutraTexture` has a new constructor taking another `LutraTexture`, which clones the texture.
- `SpriteShader` renamed to `ShaderData`, plus more types allowed as uniform buffers.
- `Scene.GetEntitiesWithCollider` added, equivalent to Otter's `Scene.GetEntities` method, taking a collider tag.
- Fix `VirtualAxis` buttons getting stuck on while disabled.
- Fix `Window.SetFullscreen` not resizing the window correctly.
- Fix debug console messages displaying incorrectly when containing '%'.
